**What is Spring ORM**
ORM is Object relational mapping. We have different ORM frameworks like hibernate,ibatis etc which we can integrate in our spring framework. We will be using hibernate
in this project.

**Advantages of using ORM in Spring**
1) Less coding
2) Better Exception Handling
3)Easy to test
4) Integrated Transaction Management.

Initially JDBC used to act as a mediator between our java application and Database. Everytime when we use to fetch the data we had to convert the data into object
manually. But now with the help of ORM we can make the objects of the data which is coming from the database automatically.

We will making use of the hibernate template class to implement all our methods.It contains the following methods.
1)Save
2) Update
3) Insert
4) Get
5) loadAll
